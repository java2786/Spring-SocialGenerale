### Some ground rules for the training/sessions
<ul>
	<li>All the participants, please be on mute mode so that other participants will not get disturbed during the session</li>
	<li>Dont try to write code with me. Just follow the instructions during demonstrations. You will get enough time to practice.</li>
	<li>If you have any doubt or question please type it on chat window, and I will try to answer it as soon as possible</li>
	<li>All the code material that I am going to type during demonstrations in session will be available on this link: <b>https://github.com/java2786/Spring-SocialGenerale</b></li>
	<li>At the end of the day, if you have any query left unresolved, feel free to write me on my mail id: <b>arunkumar31786@gmail.com</b></li>
</ul>
